# feature/home-page

## Bugs

- [ ] It seems like every time I go to the map page, things are being dynamically loaded in. It should only be loaded in once and cached
- [ ] If user doesn't allow location permissions, things bug out

## Features

- Nearby Alerts -> clicking should should show you the event on the map
- [ x ] Safety Tips -> could turn into carousel, but good enough for now
- About Tempest
